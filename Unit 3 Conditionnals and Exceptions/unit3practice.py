#Boolean Expression
#Like a mathematical formula
#Can only evaluate to True or False
#Example  - Are my shoes tied? > True
#Example - Is 5 greater than 7 > False
print(5 > 7)

#Comparison operators!  ++ < > >= <=
#Like a arithmetic operators! + - / * ** % //
#True or False as a results

x = 5       #SET x equal to 5, tell it what to be.
print(x == 5)       #GEt x equals 5, ask a question
#Difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#This is a PERFECT test question

print(4 >= 2)
print(1993 == 1993)
print(-90 < -99)
print(10 != 10)     #False, "bash" "not"
print()
